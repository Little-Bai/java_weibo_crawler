This program is written by me when I was a sophomore.

It will get the tags and weibo contents of users and insert thoes info to mysql.

All user names are in the file named "screen_name.txt".

"last_one_name.txt" record the name of the last user this crawler processed last time.

Due to the sina API limitation, this program should be run for several times by hands to continue crawing.

Of course you can let this program sleep for a while to waitting the re-authorization of Sina Weibo API.

Or write and run a shell script to run this program once an hour.

That will liberate your hands.

Maybe I will rewrite this project when I need to use it some day.

But now this code is like a shit, are you sure you want to use it?

I suggest not.
